      <h1>(Santorini)</h1>
      <img src="images/santo.jpg"/ >
      <p>The beauty of the ancient walls, the beautiful view from the beach houses. Approaching the island by boat the immediate impression obtained is this is a Greek island unlike any other. The island of Santorini was formed out of the lava from the volcanic eruption in 1660 BC. The central part of the volcano sank into the sea leading to the emergence of Santorini itself and the tiny neighbouring islands of Thirasia, Palaia and Nea Kameni close by.</p>
      <p>The island has changed names through history. Originally it was called Stroggyli ("round") since that was the shape of the island. When the Phoenicians came they named it Kallisti ("the very best"), and finally it got the name Thira after its first ruler. They also use the Euro currency after the year 01 January 2001 that is. Before that it was called a <strong>Drachma</strong> and is one of the most beautiful places I would like to visit. On top of all that I love the beauty of <strong>Greece</strong>, the country is very peaceful.You rarely hear about it on the news meaning it s well governed.</p>
      <p>It is the most active volcanic centre in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc, though what remains today is chiefly a water-filled caldera. The volcanic arc is approximately 500 km (310 mi) long and 20 to 40 km (12 to 25 mi) wide. The region first became volcanically active around 3–4 million years ago, though volcanism on Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around the Akrotiri.</p>

      <h4>Why Portuguese ?</h4>
      <p>I love the way the Portuguese speak, I love the language in general. Most of the Portuguese I have seen are from Angola and from what I saw they are friendly and welcoming with a sense of humour that is very empeccable. Portugues is a wonderful language,the way they sound when they speak, also the wording of it is amazing. Once I am able to speak the language I am also able to understand Spanish, they are very similar language</p>

        <h4>Iziko Lodge</h4>
        <img src="images/iziko.jpg"/>
        <p>The Slave Lodge was built in 1679 as the slave lodge of the Dutch East India Company. It is believed that up to 9000 slaves,
          convicts and the mentally ill lived in the building between 1679 and 1811. The Iziko website The Heritage of Slavery in South
          Africa gives details of the slave period in the history of the building.
          In 1810 the building was modified to serve as government offices. Various governmental offices were housed in the building during
          the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, for example, the Governor’s Advisory Council, the upper house of the first parliament,
          The Cape Supreme Court, the first library, the first post office, Deeds Office, and the Women’s Auxiliary Services of the South
          African Defence Force.</p>  <p>The building was restored in 1960 for use as a cultural history museum.
          The Slave Lodge, then known as the SA Cultural History Museum, opened its door as a museum on 6 April 1966.
          The SA Cultural History Museum, originally a division of the SA Museum, became an autonomous museum in 1969. In 1998 the building
          was renamed the Slave Lodge. In 2000, the museum and its associated sites amalgamated with its parent body as well as the SA National
          Gallery, the William Fehr Collection and the Michaelis Collection to form Iziko Museums of Cape Town.</p>

        <h4>Castle of Goodhope</h4>
        <img src="images/castle.jpg"/>
        <p>Built by the Dutch East India Company between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is the oldest existing colonial building in South Africa.
          It replaced an older fort called the Fort de Goede Hoop which was constructed from clay and timber and built by Jan van Riebeeck upon
          his arrival at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. </p>
        <p>Two redoubts, Redoubt Kyckuit (Lookout) and Redoubt Duijnhoop (Duneheap) were built at the mouth of the Salt River in 1654.
          The purpose of the Dutch settlement in the Cape was to act as a replenishment station for ships passing the treacherous coast around
          the Cape on long voyages between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).</p>
